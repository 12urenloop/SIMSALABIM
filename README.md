# SIMulation of Semi-Autonomous Locomotion And Behavior with Integrated Mapping (SIMSALABIM)

This could be a tool designed for simulating the behavior of runners in a semi-autonomous way, with some randomness or variability built in to mimic real-world conditions. The tool could also include a visualisation component that allows users to observe the simulated behavior in real-time or replay recorded simulations.
